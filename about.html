      <p>Cockatiels: A Guide to Their Care, Diet, and Behavior
        Introduction
        Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) are small, intelligent parrots native to Australia. They are known for their charming personalities, beautiful crests, and ability to form strong bonds with their owners. Cockatiels make excellent pets for both beginners and experienced bird enthusiasts due to their friendly and affectionate nature.
        
        Diet: What Do Cockatiels Eat?
        A balanced diet is essential for a healthy cockatiel. Their diet should include:
        
        Seeds and Pellets: A high-quality mix provides essential nutrients.
        Fresh Fruits and Vegetables: Safe options include apples, carrots, spinach, and broccoli. Avoid avocado and chocolate, as they are toxic.
        Cuttlefish Bone and Calcium Sources: Necessary for beak health and strong bones.
        Fresh Water: Must be available at all times.
        Behavior and Personality
        Cockatiels are social and intelligent birds that enjoy interaction with their owners. Some key personality traits include:
        
        Affectionate: They love head scratches and spending time with humans.
        Playful: Cockatiels enjoy toys, mirrors, and exploring their surroundings.
        Vocal: They can whistle tunes, mimic sounds, and even learn a few words. Males are usually more vocal than females.
        Bonding: They form strong attachments and can become lonely if left alone for long periods.
        Lifespan and Living Conditions
        Cockatiels can live between 15-25 years with proper care. To ensure their well-being:
        
        Provide a spacious cage (at least 24x18x24 inches).
        Offer perches of different sizes to keep their feet healthy.
        Keep the cage in a safe, warm, and quiet area, away from direct sunlight and drafts.
        Allow daily out-of-cage time for exercise and mental stimulation.
        Grooming and Health
        Wing and Nail Trimming: Regular trims prevent injuries and overgrowth.
        Bathing: Cockatiels enjoy mist sprays or shallow water for bathing.
        Veterinary Check-ups: Annual visits ensure overall health and early detection of illnesses.</p>
